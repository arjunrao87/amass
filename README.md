## Steps to flow through the application 
- Create form using typeform
- Create firebase table with the same schema as typeform 
- Provide access token for 
    - typeform
    - firebase
- Provide id for 
    - typeform form
    - firebase table
- Start up application 

## Things to validate 
- Is there a way to write from Typeform to Firebase?
    - Google Forms -> Google sheets is free
- Is Airtable better/easier than Firebase even if you have to pay?
- What other services to add to this to make it usable? 
    - Algolia? 
    - Supertokens?
